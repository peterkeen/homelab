If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this agreement or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, then this agreement shall immediately be deemed amended or modified to exclude such clause or provision and the remainder of this agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  No failure by either party to exercise a right under this agreement or under law shall operate as a waiver thereof.  No waiver of any breach of this agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other breach.  No waiver shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving party. This agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties concerning its subject matter, and supersedes all oral understandings, representations, prior discussions and preliminary agreements of any nature.  This agreement does not constitute an offer by us and it shall not be effective until we have begun to provide the services.  Except as may be specifically allowed hereunder, this agreement may not be modified or amended except by a written amendment to this agreement signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

We will notify you promptly about the situation and work with you to establish a timeline for completing our services, if possible. Michigan law governs this contract. We both agree to resolve any disputes exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Washtenaw County, Michigan and not anywhere else. You submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of those courts.
